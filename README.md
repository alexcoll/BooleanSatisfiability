# BooleanSatisfiability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem

Boolean Satisfiability is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE.

This was a project for Purdue CS182, Fundamentals of Computer Science (Discrete Mathematics). Don't copy this for your assignments, you'll probably get caught for cheating.
